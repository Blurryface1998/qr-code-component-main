## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS

### What I learned

I have learned how to use CSS clip-path. I'm not very good at it so I'll try to learn it more.

```css
.imageClip {
  clip-path: rect(22% 78% 78% 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

I'll work on how to use other ways to manipulate images in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Using clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path) - This source helped me understand clip-path property.
